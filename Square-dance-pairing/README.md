## Square dance pairing

<h2>description:</h2>

As people come to the dance floor, they should be paired off as quickly as possible: man with woman, man with woman, all the way down the line. If several men arrive in a row, they should be paired in the order they came, and likewise if several women do. Maintain a queue of "spares" (men for whom you have no women yet, or vice versa), and pair them as appropriate.

<h3>Example:</h3>

- F Jane

- M Frank

- M John

- M Sherlock

- F Madonna

- M David

- M Christopher

- F Beyonce
